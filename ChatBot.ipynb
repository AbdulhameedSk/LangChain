            "Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that explains how very tiny things—like electrons, photons, and atoms—behave. Unlike everyday objects, these tiny particles act both like particles (small bits of matter) and waves (energy that spreads out), a concept called wave-particle duality[1]. This means they don’t have definite positions or speeds until we measure them; instead, they exist as probabilities described by a \"wave function,\" which tells us the likelihood of finding a particle at a certain place and time[1][2].\n",

For example, an electron in an atom can only have specific energy levels[1]. Quantum mechanics doesn’t predict exact outcomes but instead predicts probabilities of different outcomes, which is different from classical physics that deals with large objects and predicts definite results[2][3].\n",
